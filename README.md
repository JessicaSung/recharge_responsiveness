## What is Recharge Responsiveness?
Recharge Responsiveness is a civic challenge provided by Maker Faire Austin Disaster Relief Hackathon. First responders are tasked with being responsive as possible during a disaster. Recharge Responsiveness helps communities to better mark their safety to support tools for first responders on the scene.

## Technologies used to create Recharge Responsiveness
Jaime created the landing page and intake survey with React and CSS. Users use the intake survey to mark their safety and request aid.

jendatx and RobertLRead populated the SQLite database and used Python and Flask to write API endpoints. RobertLRead used Mocha and Jest to write tests.

JessicaSung created the Responders view with React and React-Bootstrap. This page allows First Responders to filter requests by category. fancyaction created the map with markers, header, and footer. The map shows first responders where users need aid.

 JessicaSung served as project manager, performing code reviews, fixing merge conflicts, and authored documentation (this readme).
