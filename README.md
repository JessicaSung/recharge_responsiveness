## What is Mark Me Safe?
Mark Me Safe is our solution to a civic challenge presented at the 2018 Disaster Relief Hackathon, hosted by Maker Faire Austin and Experimental Civics. The challenge, Recharge Responsiveness, states:
```First responders are tasked with being responsive as possible during a disaster. Help us hack this challenge by finding ways for communities to better mark their safety to support tools for first responders on the scene.```
